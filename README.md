# Spotify Turntable
A spotify controller that looks like a cute turntable! Uses an ESP32 to connect to the Spotify API and control playback, and displays the current track on a small HDMI display. The turntable is made from a 3D-printed case.

## Setting Up
(will refine this when I get the parts)
1. Get your Spotify API credentials by creating an app on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications). You will need the Client ID and Client Secret.
2. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wenbang24/spotify-turntable
    cd spotify-turntable
    ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the repository with your Spotify API credentials:
    ```plaintext
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='your-spotify-client-id'
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET='your-spotify-client-secret'
    SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI='your-app-redirect-url'
    ```

    Note: The redirect URI can be set to `http://localhost:8888/callback` - it doesn't really matter.
4. Run the `spotify_turntable.py` script to start the application and cache authentication details:
    ```bash
    python3 spotify_turntable.py
    ```

    Follow the instructions.
