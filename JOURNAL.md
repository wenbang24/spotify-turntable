# Journal of Changes
## 2025-05-30
Spent ages fighting with spotifyd, spotify-cli-linux, spotify-tui, raspotify, librespot, and other spotify clients. None of them worked.
Eventually I made an [issue](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd/issues/1221#issuecomment-2925151914) and found out it probably will not work.
Time spent: 6 hrs
